# Introduction

## Crystal-amorphous transition

## Knot in Graphene

Knot exists every where and it’s a connection between 1D and 0D materials

## The siginificance of graphene

Graphene is suitable for the exploring of CAT base on knot

## This paper

From first principle and classical MD we explore thermal and electronic properties of graphene knot and found it’s a controllable CAT material under uniaxial  stress.
