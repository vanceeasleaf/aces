# Crystal-amorphous interface induced by graphene nano-knot

Mechanical and thermal transport properties of graphene nanoribbon knots, are systematically investigated using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. It is found that the thermal conductivity of the ribbon decreases largely due to the presence of the knots as a defect, but with the increasing of strain, the Kapitza resistance decreases, which is due to a tighter contacting of the ribbon with itself or the other. Local phonon analysis is applied to the contacting regime to reveal the influence of the contacts on the transport. This work would be helpful for a deeper understanding of thermal conducting at nanoscale and give a guidance to the field of phonon management material design.
